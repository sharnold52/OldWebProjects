                <p>This project is going to be a recreation of the flash game, Loneliness, by Jordan Magnuson. The game itself is a minimalistic "walking simulator"
                that uses mechanics, color, and music to convey the overall feeling of loneliness. The flash game is relatively simple and the "characters" of the game are simple squares.
                The color scheme is black and white to keep it as simple as possible.</p>
                <p>The game relies on a human being's natural instinct to ascribe human characteristics to inanimate objects. Everything in the game is inherently meaningless as it is just
                shapes moving around a screen, until the player decides that the squares are representations of humans because they are playing as one. When the player makes this distinction,
                the game is suddenly much more meaningful. This is what I loved about the original flash game. How it was meaningless until the player decided to give it a meaning.
                It felt more personal and I believe that it was able to hit a chord with more people than it would have if it had a clearly defined story.</p>
                <p>In my version of this flash game, I would like to tell a slightly different story. It will follow the same general idea, but it will have a different way of progressing. (More details
                in "Proposal")
